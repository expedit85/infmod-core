Inference Module


1) A list of relevant jars is listed in Libraries/jars.txt. Not all jars are required
   for building and/or running but some of them holds source code, which is useful for
   debugging purposes.

2) The source is able to be imported into eclipse, but it will not run until dependency
   jars are not downloaded.

3) In case more jars are added in the future, it would be good to update de file
   Libraries/jars.txt instead of add the jars directly.
